# Stata Code
The following will serve as sample pieces of the skills I have learned as a research assistant
and from personal research. What may be deemed as absurdities are there to respect the confidentiality clauses
of my contract under the Institute on Behavior and Inequality. The goal is build a full overview of the possible Stata tasks 
an RA may receive. To add:

1) Working with different post-estimation commands
2) Sticking to basic functions - but with advance options
3) Analysis of Variance and Panel Data (fixed/random effects models)
